--{
    First representation of a Mealy Machine
}

data Mealy (m:* -> *) a b { step : a -> m (Step m a b) } -- What is the purpose of m ?

data Emit (m:* -> *) a b { value : b; automata: Mealy m a b }
data Halt

type Step (m:* -> *) a b = Emit m a b | Halt

--{
    A Mealy automata can also be synthesised by the following type
}

kind Mealy = * -> * -> *
type Mealy a b = data M (value : forall s. s * (a * s -> b * s))

--{
    Therefore a manipulation thanks to Causal Arrow can be proposed.
